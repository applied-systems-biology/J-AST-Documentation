       title="Finding the E-Test ZOI shape" id="Finding-the-E-Test-ZOI-shape">

    <p>For most analysis algorithms to work E-Tests need to be annotated with the ZOI shape. J-AST provides automated and interactive methods to achieve this task.</p>
    <chapter title="Automated E-Test ZOI shape detection">
        <note>Please ensure that your images follow the <a href="Image-preprocessing.topic">general expectations</a> of our algorithms and apply preprocessing if necessary.</note>
        <note>Please ensure that the <a href="Finding-the-plate.topic">plate region annotation is present</a>.</note>
        <note>Please ensure that the <a href="Finding-the-E-Test-strip.topic">strip region annotation is present</a>.</note>
        You can find the E-Test strip detection algorithm by first selecting the image(s) and then navigating to <ui-path>PROCESS | E-Test | Auto-detect ETest ZOI shape (v1)</ui-path>.
        The algorithm has no parameters.
        <chapter title="Supported assay">
            Due to the complexity of this problem, our algorithm only works decently if the contrast between the colonies and the
            ZOI is very high.
            <tip>Consider manual annotation if you expect issues</tip>

        If the algorithms do not produce the expected results or if you prefer to do a manual annotation, you can use our interactive tool.
        To open it, select the image and click the <control>Edit</control> button for the ZOI shape annotation on the right-hand side.
